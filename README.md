# Tershell

Tershell was born out of a pain not having a second monitor. I wanted a way to display the outputs of a process on my phone. It does this via a webpage and a websocket for funneling std outputs to a webpage.

## How to use

Just prepend any proces with `tershell`

```bash
tershell npm run dev
```

Tershell will look for an available port and print a link to view the outputs.
